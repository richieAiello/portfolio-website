        text={`I am a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. 
          My front-end tool of choice has been React, using hooks with functional components.
          I focus on writing accessible JSX, and implementing modern ES6 JavaScript practices. 
          When styling my websites I have been utilizing SCSS, with an understanding of modern CSS
          practices ranging from CSS functions, variables, flex-box, CSS-Grid, keyframes, and more
          in order to make my websites as responsive as possible, while keeping cross-browser compatibility
          in mind. I am currently learning Tailwind CSS, with plans to learn Typescript, Redux, and Vite, 
          eventually moving to Next.js to learn back-end development as well. I currently live in Long Island, 
          New York, and I am searching for a remote position, preferably full-time. When I am not coding or 
          reading fantasy novels, youâ€™ll find  me bouldering outdoors. I would love for you to check out
          my work!`}
